(** The smart contract rollup refutation game types are defined here, as
    well as the basic pure logic for:

    - how to create a new game from a pair of commits in the commit tree;

    - how to update a game or complete a game when a move is played.

    This game logic is used by the protocol when two commitments are in
    conflict to determine which one of the commitments is wrong.

    Game state and moves
    ====================

    At any given moment, the game stores a list [dissection] of state
    hashes and tick counts. These are the claims about the PVM history
    made by the player who has just moved.

    The next player to move will specify a tick count which appears in
    the [dissection]; this is the last of the state hashes which she
    agrees with. She will then either:

    - provide a new [dissection] by giving a list of state hashes and
    tick counts that starts at the chosen tick count and ends at the
    next tick count in the previous [dissection]. It must agree at the
    start but disagree with the final state.

    - if the tick difference between this state and the next is one,
    there is no 'room' for a new [dissection]. In this case she must
    provide a Merkle proof that shows the step in the current
    [dissection] is invalid.

    Initializing a game
    ===================

    In order to trigger the start of a game, one player must publish a
    first move.

    The [initial] function is called at this point. It converts a
    parent-chid pair of commitments (belonging to the other player) into
    an initial [dissection]. The first move is immediately applied to
    this to give the first state of the game.

    Note: it is quite possible for the game to end immediately after
    this first move, either if the commitment has a tick count of one or
    more probably if the refutation proves that the commitment was
    'premature' (the state is not blocked---there are further
    computation steps to do or more inbox messages to read).

    Expected properties
    ===================

    P1 - If [dissection] is honest, the next move must be dishonest:

      There is only one honest state hash for a given tick count. The
      next player must provide a different hash to the honest hash in
      the [dissection].

    P2 - If [dissection] is dishonest, there is a strategy for a player
    equipped with a perfect PVM to play an honest next move:

      The player with a perfect PVM can calculate honest hashes until
      one disagrees with the [dissection], and challenge the dissection
      at that point, publishing either an honest [dissection] or an
      honest [Proof].

    Each [dissection] has a maximum tick count step shorter than the
    last, so by induction using P1 and P2 we have

    P1' - If [dissection] is honest, the last player has a winning
    strategy.

    P2' - If [dissection] is dishonest, the next player has a winning
    strategy.

    This allows us to see the following. (We use [refuter] to mean the
    first player to move, and [defender] to mean the other player.)

    Honest refuter wins:
      An honest refuter will be refuting a dishonest commitment, because
      there is only one honest state possible per level. Therefore the
      initial [dissection] will be dishonest. By P2' the refuter has a
      winning strategy.

    Honest defender wins:
      An honest defender will have made an honest commitment which will
      be translated into an honest initial [dissection]. By P1' the
      defender has a winning strategy.

    In the case that both players are dishonest the outcome is slightly
    harder to determine---it basically comes down to which player gets
    to play the final move. That means that in this case the refutation
    game is equivalent to a finite game of nim (by the Sprague-Grundy
    Theorem, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague-Grundy_theorem). However,
    this fact is completely irrelevant, because if the rollup is working
    correctly the winner will subsequently be defeated by some honest
    opponent.

  (** There are three cases for a refutation game proof:

      [Computation_step]: a simple step in the PVM that doesn't involve
      any interaction with the inbox.

      [Input_step]: a step in which the PVM 'reads' from the inbox. This
      will include a proof that the machine is in a blocked state and a
      proof that the next message to be read is correct. The inbox proof
      part of this will refer to the [inbox_snapshot] stored in the game
      type (see {!Sc_rollup_game_repr.t}).

      [Blocked_step]: similar to an input step, this is a step where the
      machine is in a blocked state. However, it includes a proof that
      there are no further messages in the inbox at the current level.
      This means the machine is genuinely blocked and the [stop] state
      of this [Proof] will be [None]. *)

   A game state is characterized by:

    - [turn], the player that must provide the next move.

    - [inbox_snapshot], a snapshot of the inbox state at the moment the
      game is created. This is only used when checking [Input_step] and
      [Blocked_step] proofs; it makes the proofs easier to create---
      otherwise they would have a 'moving target' because the actual
      inbox may be updated continuously.

    - [dissection], a list of states with tick counts. The current
      player will specify, in the next move, a tick count that
      indicates the last of these states that she agrees with.

    Invariants:
    -----------
    - [dissection] must contain at least 3 values
    - only the last value in [dissection] may be [None]
    - [inbox_snapshot] never changes once the game is created

    [initial inbox parent child refuter defender] will construct an
    initial game where [refuter] is next to play. The game has
    [dissection] with three states:

      - firstly, the state (with tick zero) of [parent], the commitment
      that both stakers agree on.

      - secondly, the state and tick count of [child], the commitment
      that [defender] has staked on.

      - thirdly, a [None] state which is a single tick after the [child]
      commitment. This represents the claim, implicit in the commitment,
      that the state given is blocked.
    
    This gives [refuter] a binary choice: she can refute the commit
    itself by providing a new dissection between the two committed
    states, or she can refute the claim that the [child] commit is a
    blocked state by immediately providing a proof of a single tick
    increment from that state to its successor. *)
