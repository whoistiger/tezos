(** There are three cases for a refutation game proof:

    [Computation_step]: a simple step in the PVM that doesn't involve
    any interaction with the inbox.

    [Input_step]: a step in which the PVM 'reads' from the inbox. This
    will include a proof that the machine is in a blocked state and a
    proof that the next message to be read is correct. The inbox proof
    part of this will refer to the [inbox_snapshot] stored in the game
    type (see {!Sc_rollup_game_repr.t}).

    [Blocked_step]: similar to an input step, this is a step where the
    machine is in a blocked state. However, it includes a proof that
    there are no further messages in the inbox at the current level.
    This means the machine is genuinely blocked and the [stop] state
    of this [Proof] will be [None]. *)
